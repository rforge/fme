Description: Provides functions to help in fitting models to data, to perform monte carlo, sensitivity and identifiability analysis. It is intended to work with models be written as a set of differential equations that are solved either by an integration routine from package deSolve, or a steady-state solver from package rootSolve. However, the methods can also be used with other types of functions.
