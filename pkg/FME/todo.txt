  ToDo

  ThPe-> ThPe: improve example "mcystmodel.R" accordingly
  
  ThPe-> ThPe: improve structure modFit a little bit?
    (try vectorization)

  KS -> ThPe: (sensFun) 

  **KS btw ** , in these plotting codes I check whether "main" is part
  of the dots, and then adjust accordingly. Problem is that "main"
  remains part of the dots, so I cannot pass the dots anymore to the
  plot function.  To be really flexible, I would need to be able to
  remove "main" from the dots. Is this possible? (and do you
  understand what I mean?).

  ThPe: yes I understand and yes, it's possible. My task.

  
  modMCMC
  ThPe -> KS: Great!!! 
  (but I still  need to order a book to understand all options)
  
  KS -> ThPe the problem is there are no good books unless you are a
  statistician - at least I haven't discovered them yet.
  Gelman et al is nice, ... but difficult ; first time I
  read it, I understood only the first page. Now I see more and more
  useful stuff.
  
  I learnt most from a PhD thesis
  Laine, M, 2008. Adaptive MCMC methods with applications in environmental
  and geophysical models, Finnish meteorological institute contributions n0 69
  -ISBN 978-951-697-662-7, Finnish meteorological institute, Helsinki.

  which I found on the web; it explains very nicely the error variance

  Part of the R-code is also adapted on the matlab code
  developed by Marco Laine; I contacted him, and he was quire pleased with the
  fact that his code was used.
