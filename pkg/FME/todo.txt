- 2009-03-11: just started to make me familiar with FME

- 2009-03-16: KS : thanks for this input!  Below I use ** KS **

- 2009-03-16 23:50: a few answer

Comments

- Norm: there is already a package mvtnorm with function rmvnorm
- but, I understand (to some extent), that it is useful to have Unif,
  Norm, Grid, ... with consistent interface, ...
  
  **KS** So I left Norm as it is...
  ThPe: ok  

- todo: add a seealso to the repective functions in "stats"
  **KS** seealso rnorm, runif, seq
  ThPe: ok


ThPe's comments

o understand details of modFit and modCost
  - try to combine the approaches of FME and simecol
  - FME: more optimizers, Hessian, weighting, user specified cost function,
    S3 methods to work with the output
  - simecol: better vectorization (less looping) i.e. slightly faster
    appproxTime, use of simObj'ects as models

==>  o.k., tested: modFit is **great** - and works well with simecol, 
  see package vignette of simecol and new example
  "modFit_with_simecol.R"
  
  ToDo:
  - improve example "mcystmodel.R" accordingly

  ** KS ** Or remove this example  entirely ? It was there for you...
  ThPe: yes, thanks, it is my task.
  
  - ??: improve structure modFit a little bit?
  ** KS ** Please be more specific. What would you like to see
  changed?
  
  ThPe: try vectorization; my task; not sure if necessary
  
  - ??: write method in simecol that makes use of modFit!
  ** KS ** This is up to you
  ThPe: of course, my task. Already there: doc in *my* vignette
  
  
o sensFun
  - write method for simObj'ects
==> Not yet a method, but sensFun with simecol was no problem.
  
  - comment: mathematical formulae (and typesetting) need some
    improvement, 
    syntax is:  \eqn{latex}{ascii} and \deqn{latex}{ascii}
    **KS** I thought I consistently used that - but there was an error in the
    L1 norm help. Perhaps you did not like my ascii version?  y_i
    etc...
   
    ThPe: y_i is fine, but perfect formula are indeed difficult, not
    sure where it was but I let it on the "list of observed items" ;-)

  - plot functions: 
      main title overwrites scale, 
      ** KS ** don't understand

      ThPe:I'll try to find it again.
     
      replace ylab = "-" in plot.sensFun  with something more readable
      ** KS ** changed to "sensitivity"

      ThPe: ok
   
   **KS btw ** , in these plotting codes I check whether "main" is part of the
   dots, and then adjust accordingly. Problem is that "main" remains part of the
   dots, so I cannot pass the dots anymore to the plot function.
   To be really flexible, I would need to be able
   to remove "main" from the dots. Is this possible? (and do you understand what I mean?).

   ThPe: yes I understand and yes, it's possible. My task.

  - sensFun is useful,
    - but collinearity index is fine, see also improved (?) plot
    ** KS** I accepted this improvement. Much clearer
    ThPe: ok

o modCRL, sensRange
  - that's similar to things I usually do
  - please explain "what" in the help page (with example)

  ** KS ** done!
  ThPe: hmm, it's really easy, I have obviously missed tomething in my example
  
o modMCMC
  - not yet tested
  
  **KS** it is the best part!  (also the more difficult one!)

  ThPe: Sure!!! I intend to invest some more time before I can say something.
