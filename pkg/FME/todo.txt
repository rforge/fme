New issues from 2010-01-05:

Karline please check the following (line numbers in .R may have changed):

modFit, L 204:
-------------
- line 128ff, paragraph about the renamed list elements!  KS: DONE
- is the following correct: "\eqn{2*J^T*J}" ? KS: DON't understand... J^T*J is 0.5*hessian
 --> the code says: res$hessian <- 2 * t(Jac)%*%Jac 

modMCMC
-------
L193: missing parenthesis?
DONT UNDERSTAND. SEE NO PROBLEM THERE..
ThPe, check:

all .Rd files
-------------
- check \eqn and \deqn (in ASCII->HTML and Latex->PDF)

all .R files
------------
- proofread: done

vignettes
---------
- ???

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Old Issues: check if already done!
==================================
 

modFit.R
========

ThPe:

 - make overrule a general usable (but not exported) function in FME
 - can I do this?
 
Ks->ThPe; it is but a small function; yes you can.

=============================================


modCost.R
=========

1e-500 does not prevent log(0) because 

> .Machine$double.xmin
[1] 2.225074e-308

plot.modcost

- Why "c(16:24)" -- simply "16:24" (etc.) should be enough.
KS: it needs () => (16:24)[...] is ok


sensFun.R
=========

- line 100ff: why 1e-20 as "very small" number?
KS->ThPE.  No reason. Suggestion?
