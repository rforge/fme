  ToDo

  ThPe-> ThPe: improve example "mcystmodel.R" accordingly
  
  ThPe-> ThPe: improve structure modFit a little bit?
    (try vectorization)

  KS -> ThPe: (sensFun) 

  **KS btw ** , in these plotting codes I check whether "main" is part
  of the dots, and then adjust accordingly. Problem is that "main"
  remains part of the dots, so I cannot pass the dots anymore to the
  plot function.  To be really flexible, I would need to be able to
  remove "main" from the dots. Is this possible? (and do you
  understand what I mean?).

  ThPe: yes I understand and yes, it's possible. My task.

  
  modMCMC
  ThPe -> KS: Great!!! 
  (but I still  need to order a book to understand all options)
