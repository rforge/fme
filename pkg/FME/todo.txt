- 2009-03-11: just started to make me familiar with FME

Comments

- Norm: there is already a package mvtnorm with function rmvnorm
- but, I understand (to some extent), that it is useful to have Unif,
  Norm, Grid, ... with consistent interface, ...
- todo: add a seealso to the repective functions in "stats"




ThPe's comments

o understand details of modFit and modCost
  - try to combine the approaches of FME and simecol
  - FME: more optimizers, Hessian, weighting, user specified cost function,
    S3 methods to work with the output
  - simecol: better vectorization (less looping) i.e. slightly faster
    appproxTime, use of simObj'ects as models

==>  o.k., tested: modFit is **great** - and works well with simecol, 
  see package vignette of simecol and new example
  "modFit_with_simecol.R"
  
  ToDo:
  - improve example "mcystmodel.R" accordingly
  - ??: improve structure modFit a little bit?
  - ??: write method in simecol that makes use of modFit!

o sensFun
  - write method for simObj'ects
==> Not yet a method, but sensFun with simecol was no problem.
  
  - comment: mathematical formulae (and typesetting) need some
    improvement, 
    syntax is:  \eqn{latex}{ascii} and \deqn{latex}{ascii}

  - plot functions: 
      main title overwrites scale, 
      replace ylab = "-" in plot.sensFun  with something more readable

  - sensFun may be useful in general, however I would do this a little
    bit different, taking biologists perspective, so I cannot really
    comment on this.

o modMCMC
  - can this be useful for simObj'ects
