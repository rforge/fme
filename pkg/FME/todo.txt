Added plot.obs from version 1.1.1 to plot observed data at once.
Added and revised cross2long and gaussianWeights functions (TomVE; Nov 10, 2011)

thpe: it would be nice to have a  "predict.modFit" method

Made collin function faster, as suggested by Jeremy David Silver.
This changes the output slightly, when collin is very very large (near infinity).
This is due to a different method for estimating eigenvalues, when this is near to zero.
At not too large collinearities, both methods are the same.
As the time gain is substantial, the new method is retained.

The difference is:
## original:
      id  <- 1 / sqrt(min(eigen(t(S) %*% S)$value)) # collinearity

## NOW: only calculate eigenvalues, use symmetry, make the cross product more efficient
      id <- 1/sqrt(max(0,tail(eigen(crossprod(S),only.values=TRUE,symmetric=TRUE)$value,1)))


---------------

Added bobyqa optimizer from minqa package

Todo: complete documentation and cite paper.
