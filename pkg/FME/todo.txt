  ToDo


ThPe --> KS?

 - is it possible to avoid "global" assignments with "<<-" in modFit,
   collin, modMCMC?

 - note also that <<- does not necessarily assign to globals

 - I don't understand the logic why this was unavoidable ... and this
   misunderstanding is quite natural as <<- is known to break
   structure and exactly due to this reason I (until now)
   avoided this.

 - on the other hand, <<- seems to be not uncommon if used in local
   functions and also standard functions of R use it this way.

modFit.R

ThPe:

 - make overrule a general usable (but not exported) function in FME
 - can I do this?
