New issues from 2010-01-05:

Karline please check the following (line numbers in .R may have changed):

modFit, L 204:
-------------
- line 128ff, paragraph about the renamed list elements!
- is the following correct: "\eqn{2*J^T*J}" ?
 --> the code says: res$hessian <- 2 * t(Jac)%*%Jac 

modMCMC
-------
L193: missing parenthesis?

ThPe, check:

all .Rd files
-------------
- check \eqn and \deqn (in ASCII->HTML and Latex->PDF)

all .R files
------------
- proofread: done

vignettes
---------
- ???

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Old Issues: check if already done!
==================================

 ToDo
Ks -> ThPe
 - made S3 plot methods the same as in deSolve.
 - (ask and mfrow/mfcol settings)
    -> wrote a generic function, in utilities.R

 - Need to keep plotmod and histmod?? (the former is now better
   in plot.deSolve..., but histmod does not (yet) exist)
 
 - Need to put this one on CRAN fast; many of our other packages start depending
 on it (e.g. BCE); the modMCMC is very efficient.
 
 

modFit.R
========

ThPe:

 - make overrule a general usable (but not exported) function in FME
 - can I do this?
 
Ks->ThPe; it is but a small function; yes you can.

modCost.R
=========

1e-500 does not prevent log(0) because 

> .Machine$double.xmin
[1] 2.225074e-308

plot.modcost

- Why "c(16:24)" -- simply "16:24" (etc.) should be enough.


sensFun.R
=========

- line 100ff: why 1e-20 as "very small" number?
