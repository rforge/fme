- 2009-03-11: just started to make me familiar with FME

Comments

- Norm: there is already a package mvtnorm with function rmvnorm
- but, I understand (to some extent), that it is useful to have Unif,
  Norm, Grid, ... with consistent interface, ...
- todo: add a seealso to the repective functions in "stats"


ThPe's next steps:

o understand details of modFit and modCost
  - try to combine the approaches of FME and simecol
  - FME: more optimizers, Hessian, weighting, user specified cost function,
    S3 methods to work with the output
  - simecol: better vectorization (less looping) i.e. slightly faster
    appproxTime, use of simObj'ects as models
  - ??: improve structure modFit a little bit?
  - ??: write method in simecol that makes use of modFit!

o sensFun
  - write method for simObj'ects

o modMCMC
  - can this be useful for simObj'ects
